# Data Collection and Analisys

Here you can find all aquired data and its analisys

## Data Collection 

To get data severeal libraries were used:

- **Requests and BeautifulSoup**: Data collection and extraction
- **Elsapy**: Special library for work with Elsevier API
- **selenium**: For references extraction

All process of data extraction can be found in [preprocess.py](preprocess.py) and [data_collection.py](data_collection.py)

## Data Analisys

Since raw data is hard to work with we cleaned and normalised it. To do so we used following ilibraries:

- **Numpy and Pandas**: Data analisys and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib**: Visualisation of statistics

Analisys flow and results could be found in [analisys.ipynb](analisys.ipynb)
